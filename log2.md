# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2
Here is my second attempt at learning JS. I'm starting again with Angela Yu's video course on Udemy. Wish me happiness, progress and fulfilment in my endeavours.


### Day 2 - 20th March 2021 ~ Clear-headed, complaining stomach

Didn't complete this yesterday as I had a bad stomach and felt like shit. Today I continued with the web dev course and went back over prompts, alerts, the length property, slice and toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(). Next lesson is arithmetic so thought this would be a good place to leave it.


### Day 1 - 18th March 2021 ~ Warm, enthused

I've chosen my "best hour" of the day to start this. That hour is 1pm until 2pm.

Here is the last note from when I was keeping this log last, I'm still into it:

### Note:
Create a positive word generator using words from the following site:

Working directly within the console in Chrome, Angela has another way to execute code that is apparently less cumbersome. Inspect > Sources > >> > Snippets.

This seems to give you a nested text editor similar to Atom.

alert(); is a shorter way of writing the full statement which is window.alert();


### Note:
I've just thought about the things I need to be happy. Though previously this list was things I "need", this is actually inaccurate. The list should be things I need to be HAPPY. Anyway, all I had on my list previously was novelty, and I would now like to add a second, which is LEARNING.


There are two different types of speech quotes. The ones used in programming are actually different to the ones you'd find in a word processor, as they're the same at the beginning and end "". " is preferred to ' in except in some situations. The following document is useful as a reference for writing JS in a consistent manner: https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js


### Note:
There's also a book for writing called The Elements of Style: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style




```typeof();``` shows what type of data is in the parentheses

Went back over declaring variables with var and did a small puzzle.
